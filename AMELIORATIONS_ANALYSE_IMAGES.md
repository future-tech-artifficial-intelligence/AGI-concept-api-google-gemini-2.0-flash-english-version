**Image Analysis Improvements**

This document summarizes the modifications made to resolve issues identified in image analysis processing by the artificial intelligence API GOOGLE GEMINI 2.0 FLASH.

## Identified Issues

1.  **Excessive phrases at the start of analysis**: The artificial intelligence API GOOGLE GEMINI 2.0 FLASH systematically began its image analyses with "Absolutely! I am delighted to be able to help you. Yes, I feel emotions when analyzing this image Image Analysis".

2.  **Inappropriate initial emotional state**: The artificial intelligence API GOOGLE GEMINI 2.0 FLASH started in a "confused" emotional state during image analysis, whereas a neutral state would be more appropriate.

3.  **Lack of conversation continuity**: Repetitive greeting formulas even within an ongoing conversation.

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. `conversation_context_manager.py` Module

*   Added specific detection patterns for image analysis responses.
*   Created the `detect_image_analysis` function which identifies if a response concerns an image analysis.
*   Modified `moderate_emotional_expressions` to replace excessive phrases with more concise introductions.

```python
# Specific patterns for image analysis responses
IMAGE_ANALYSIS_PATTERNS = [
    r"(?i)^(Absolument\s?!?\s?Je suis ravi de pouvoir t'aider\.?\s?Oui,?\s?je ressens des Ã©motions en analysant cette image\s?Analyse de l'image)",
    r"(?i)^(Je suis (ravi|heureux|content) de pouvoir analyser cette image pour toi\.?\s?Analyse de l'image)",
    r"(?i)^(Analyse de l'image\s?:?\s?)"
]

def detect_image_analysis(response: str) -> bool:
    """Detects if the response is an image analysis."""
    # Implementation of detection...
```

### 2. `emotional_engine.py` Module

*   Added the `initialize_emotion` function which allows specifying the initialization context.
*   Added logic to start with a neutral emotional state for image analyses.
*   Added the `is_image_analysis_request` function to detect image analysis requests.

```python
def initialize_emotion(context_type=None):
    """Initializes the emotional state based on the context."""
    # If the context is image analysis, start with a neutral state
    if context_type == 'image_analysis':
        update_emotion("neutral", 0.5, trigger="image_analysis_start")
        return
    
    # For any other context, choose a random emotion...
```

### 3. `gemini_api.py` Module

*   Automatic detection of image analysis requests.
*   Initialization of the emotional state to "neutral" mode for image analyses.
*   Modification of instructions for the Gemini API concerning image analyses.

```python
# Modification of the system prompt for image analysis
IMAGE ANALYSIS: You have the ability to analyze images in detail. When an image is shown to you:
1. Start directly by describing what you see precisely and in detail
2. Identify important elements in the image
3. If relevant, explain what the image represents
4. You can express your impression of the image but in a moderate and natural way

IMPORTANT: NEVER START your response with "Absolutely! I am delighted to be able to help you." 
or "I feel emotions when analyzing this image". 
Start directly with the image description.```

## Tests Performed

A test script was created to verify the proper functioning of the modifications:

*   Test of the removal of excessive phrases.
*   Test of image analysis detection.
*   Test of the initial emotional state for image analyses.

## Expected Results

*   Image analyses begin directly with the image description, without excessive phrases.
*   The artificial intelligence API GOOGLE GEMINI 2.0 FLASH starts in a neutral emotional state for image analyses.
*   Conversations are more natural, without repetition of greeting formulas.
