I'm delighted to help you find a balanced and vegetarian recipe on the Simple and Quick Vegetarian Menus website! I've browsed the site and here are some suggestions that seem particularly interesting for this season (we're in summer 2025):

Moreover, Summer Lentil Salad: This salad is fresh, rich in protein and fiber thanks to the lentils. It can be garnished with seasonal vegetables like tomatoes, cucumbers, and peppers. A light vinaigrette made with lemon and fresh herbs will add a touch of freshness. Summer Vegetable Curry with Coconut Milk: A vegetable curry is always a good option for a balanced and tasty meal. Use seasonal vegetables like zucchini, eggplant, green beans, and snow peas. The coconut milk will bring an exotic and creamy touch. Serve this curry with whole basmati rice for a complete meal. Marinated Tofu and Grilled Vegetable Skewers: Marinated tofu is an excellent source of plant-based protein. Cut the tofu into cubes and marinate it in a sauce made with soy sauce, ginger, garlic, and honey. Thread the tofu cubes onto skewers with seasonal vegetables like cherry tomatoes, red onions, and mushrooms. Grill the skewers on the barbecue or griddle.

To summarize, These recipes seem well suited for the summer season and offer good nutritional balance. I hope you'll like these suggestions!
