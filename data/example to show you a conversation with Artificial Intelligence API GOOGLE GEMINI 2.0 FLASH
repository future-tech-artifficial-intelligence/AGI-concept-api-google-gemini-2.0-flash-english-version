Hello! I'm very happy to continue helping you in your search for balanced vegetarian recipes.

After exploring the Green Cuisine website, I recommend the following recipe:

Winter Vegetable Curry with Coconut Milk: [https://www.green-cuisine.fr/recettes/curry-de-legumes-d-hiver-au-lait-de-coco](https://www.green-cuisine.fr/recettes/curry-de-legumes-d-hiver-au-lait-de-coco)

Why I recommend this recipe:

Furthermore, Balanced: It contains a good variety of vegetables (carrots, sweet potatoes, spinach), a source of plant-based protein (chickpeas), and spices to enhance the taste without adding too much salt. Vegetarian: It's entirely plant-based. Seasonal: It uses winter vegetables, which is ideal for this time of year. Easy to prepare: The recipe is simple and doesn't require hard-to-find ingredients. Tasty: The coconut milk and spices bring a rich and comforting flavor.

To summarize, I hope you'll enjoy this recipe! Don't hesitate if you need other suggestions or if you have questions about the recipe.
