**Improvements for Analyzing All Types of Images**

## Identified Problems

1. **Repetitive and Generic Descriptions:** The GOOGLE GEMINI 2.0 FLASH API tended to provide standardized descriptions for images in the same category, without taking into account the unique specificities of each image.

2. **Lack of Personalization:** Analyses did not adapt sufficiently to the context of the question posed by the user.

3. **Limited Detection:** The system did not effectively detect certain types of images and image analysis requests.

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. `gemini_api.py` Module

- Generalized instructions for all types of images, encouraging unique and personalized descriptions.
- Specific directives per image category (astronomy, art, landscapes, etc.).
- Guidelines to systematically adapt the response to the question asked.

```python
IMAGE ANALYSIS: You have the ability to analyze images in detail. For ANY type of image:
1. ABSOLUTELY AVOID repetitive and generic formulations regardless of the image category
2. Start directly by describing what you see in a precise, detailed, and PERSONALIZED way
3. Focus on the SPECIFIC ELEMENTS OF THIS PARTICULAR IMAGE and not on generalities
4. Adapt your answer to the QUESTION ASKED rather than making a generic standard description
5. Mention the unique or interesting characteristics specific to this precise image
6. Identify the important elements that distinguish this image from other similar images

SPECIFIC IMAGE TYPES:
- Astronomical Images: Focus on the precise constellations, planets, relative positions of celestial objects
- Works of Art: Identify the style, technique, symbolic elements particular to this work
- Landscapes: Describe the specific geographic elements, the light, the unique atmosphere of this place
- People: Focus on the expressions, postures, actions, and particular context
- Documents/Texts: Analyze the specific visible content, the layout, and relevant information
- Schemas/Diagrams: Explain the specific structure and the information represented
```

### 2. `conversation_context_manager.py` Module

- Major extension of detection patterns to cover all types of images.
- Organization of keywords by category (astronomy, art, nature, technical, etc.).
- Improved detection of varied formulations describing an image.

```python
# Generic keywords for image analyses
image_keywords = [
    r"(?i)(this image shows)",
    r"(?i)(in this image,)",
    r"(?i)(the image presents)",
    // ...and several other patterns
]

# Keywords by image category
category_keywords = {
    # Astronomical Images
    "astronomy": [
        r"(?i)(constellation[s]? (of|from|the))",
        // ...other astronomical patterns
    ],
    # Works of Art and Creative Images
    "art": [
        r"(?i)(painting|artwork)",
        // ...other artistic patterns
    ],
    // ...and other categories
}
```

### 3. `emotional_engine.py` Module

- Considerable extension of detection patterns for image analysis requests.
- Addition of numerous patterns to cover different ways of requesting an image analysis.
- Categorization of requests (general analysis, specific questions, information requests, contextualization).

```python
# General keywords for detecting image analysis requests
image_request_keywords = [
    # General analysis requests
    r"(?i)(analy[zs]e (this|the|a|an) image)",
    // ...several other patterns
    
    # Specific questions about the image
    r"(?i)(what (is|do you see|does it represent|does it show) (this|the) image)",
    // ...other types of questions
    
    # Contextualization requests
    r"(?i)(how (do you interpret|do you understand) this image)",
    // ...other contextualization patterns
]```

## Expected Results

- More varied, precise, and personalized image analyses for all types of images.
- Better adaptation of responses to the specific context of each question.
- Improved detection of image analysis requests.
- More natural user experience and more balanced conversations.

## Recommended Tests

To verify that the modifications are effective:
1. Present the GOOGLE GEMINI 2.0 FLASH API with images from different categories (astronomy, art, nature, documents, etc.).
2. Ask various questions about each image.
3. Verify that the descriptions are not repetitive and that they adapt well to the question.
4. Confirm that the GOOGLE GEMINI 2.0 FLASH API focuses on the specific and unique elements of each image.
