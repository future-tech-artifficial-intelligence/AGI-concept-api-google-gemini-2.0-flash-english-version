Gravity causes these clouds to collapse into protostars.
When the core temperature reaches 10 million Kelvin, nuclear fusion begins.
Stars spend most of their lives on the main sequence.
The initial mass determines stellar evolution and lifespan.

STELLAR CLASSIFICATION

O-type stars are blue and very hot (30000-50000 K).
M-type stars are red and relatively cool (2500-3500 K).
Our Sun is a G-type star with a temperature of 5778 K.

STELLAR EVOLUTION

They expel their outer layers, forming planetary nebulae.
The residual core becomes a very dense and hot white dwarf.
Massive stars (> 8 solar masses) explode as supernovae.
After the explosion, either a neutron star or a black hole remains.
