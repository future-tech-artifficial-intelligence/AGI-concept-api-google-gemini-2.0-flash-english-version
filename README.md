## Introduction

The AGI-concept-api-google-gemini-2.0-flash project is an ambitious, completely free and open-source initiative aimed at developing Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) or potentially Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) based on Google's Gemini API model, specifically Gemini 2.0 Flash, using specialized Python modules. Unlike conventional intelligence artificielle API GOOGLE GEMINI 2.0 FLASH systems limited to specific tasks, our goal is to create artificial intelligence with general cognitive abilities, emotional awareness, and multimodal world understanding.

Our ASI vision can evolve along two main paths:
1. An intelligence artificielle API GOOGLE GEMINI 2.0 FLASH hosted in distributed server infrastructure, capable of interacting with the world via internet and various connected systems
2. Integration into humanoid robotic platforms, combining advanced intelligence with physical presence and direct real-world interaction capabilities

The project follows an evolutionary trajectory:

- **Advanced phase**: Expansion towards true AGI capable of independent learning and abstract reasoning
- **Final phase**: Potential development towards ASI with capabilities exceeding human intelligence in all domains

## Vision

Our vision centers around an intelligence artificielle API GOOGLE GEMINI 2.0 FLASH that:
- Possesses general and deep world understanding
- Develops emotional awareness
- Interacts with all data types (text, images, sound)
- Continuously evolves and improves
- Maintains ethical and benevolent architecture

## Technology and Searx Integration

This project exploits the advanced capabilities of the latest multimodal language models (LLM), notably via the Google Gemini API. The key innovation lies in the strategic use of specialized Python modules that extend the capabilities of base models, complemented by the revolutionary integration of Searx.

### What is Searx?

Searx is a free and open source metasearch engine that acts as an intermediary between the user and traditional search engines. In our artificial intelligence context, Searx becomes a powerful tool that allows our intelligence artificielle API GOOGLE GEMINI 2.0 FLASH to access the most recent web information in real time.

### Advantages of Searx for Artificial Intelligence:

1. **Privacy respect**: Searx does not store personal data and protects anonymity during searches
2. **Aggregated search**: Combines results from multiple search engines (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, Wikipedia, YouTube, etc.)
3. **No advertising**: Provides pure search results, without advertising influence
4. **Advanced customization**: Allows precise configuration of sources and types of content searched
5. **Open source accessibility**: Open source code allowing modifications according to our artificial intelligence needs

### How our intelligence artificielle API GOOGLE GEMINI 2.0 FLASH uses Searx:

Our intelligence artificielle API GOOGLE GEMINI 2.0 FLASH integrates Searx in an intelligent and autonomous way:

- **Contextual detection**: The intelligence artificielle API GOOGLE GEMINI 2.0 FLASH analyzes your question and automatically determines if a web search would enrich its response
- **Multi-domain search**: According to the type of question, it adapts its search strategy (news, academic research, technology, etc.)
- **Intelligent synthesis**: Searx results are analyzed, filtered and naturally integrated into the conversation
- **Cross-verification**: The intelligence artificielle API GOOGLE GEMINI 2.0 FLASH compares information from different sources to ensure reliability
- **Continuous learning**: Each search improves the intelligence artificielle API GOOGLE GEMINI 2.0 FLASH's ability to identify when and how to search

This synergy between Gemini 2.0 Flash and Searx creates a truly autonomous intelligence artificielle API GOOGLE GEMINI 2.0 FLASH, capable of completing its knowledge in real time and providing always updated information.

Session 1: Conversation ‚Üí Memorization + Learning
Session 2: Conversation + Previous memory ‚Üí Evolution
Session 3: Conversation + Complete history ‚Üí Developed personality
```

### SQLite Integration in Our Project:

1. **Emotional Storage**:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE emotions (
       id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
       emotion_type TEXT,
       intensity REAL,
       context TEXT,
       timestamp DATETIME,
       user_id TEXT
   );
   ```

2. **Conversational Memory**:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE conversations (
       id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
       user_input TEXT,
       ai_response TEXT,
       emotional_state TEXT,
       learning_points TEXT,
       timestamp DATETIME
   );
   ```

3. **Evolutionary User Profiles**:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE user_profiles (
       user_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
       preferences TEXT,
       interaction_style TEXT,
       topics_of_interest TEXT,

user: "How are you today?"
ai: "Hello Marie! Based on our 14 previous conversations, 
     I notice you prefer morning discussions. 
     How did your gardening project we talked about go?"
# ‚Üí SQLite uses: conversation_history, preferences, mentioned_projects

# Day 100: Personalized intelligence artificielle API GOOGLE GEMINI 2.0 FLASH
user: "I had a difficult day"
ai: "I can sense it in your tone, Marie. Like the other times when you 
     felt this way, would you like to talk about your favorite 
     relaxation techniques? I remember that meditation and 
     chamomile tea help you a lot."
# ‚Üí SQLite uses: emotional_patterns, effective_solutions, adapted_personality
```

### Unique Technical Advantages:
